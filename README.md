# TokenSecretAuth

TokenSecretAuth aims to be a simple implementation of token+secret authentication.

Clients using this can send a token + secret that looks like: `{ token: "koV3Zel321fe", secret: "fffixk5ptz2puaf1sk3wo5szpkrpjnhp" }`

* **token** is a hashed form of the model **id**

* **secret** is randomly assigned and can be **encrypted** using `has_secure_password` or a similar implementation.

## Why should I use this?


> OR Why did you release this?

Many APIs use a token or a token+secret to authenticate API clients.  If that token+secret grants similar power as a login+password it **should be protected just like a password**

However, while looking for a gem to handle mobile API authentication I found that many solutions fit into one of two categories:

1. They required Devise
1. They did not encrypt the token (or secret) properly


### Other benefits

* It's plain-old ruby - any model that responds to `.find(id)` and works with or in a manner similar to `has_secure_password` will work. (model instance should respond to `model_instance#password=`)
*  Flexible: you can send token+secret in the URL or in the header or any other way you can interpret in a controller method.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'token_secret_auth'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install token_secret_auth

In your model file add:

    include TokenSecretAuth

> This grants your model instances the following methods: `#token, #decode_token, #generate_secret`

Also add to the model:

    has_secure_password

Create and run a migration to add the `password_digest` field to your model.  
For example on rails:

    $ rails generate migration AddPasswordDigestToApiClients password_digest:string
    
Note: you do not need a 'token' field on your model.  `#token` is a virtual attribute derived from the model ID.  `password` is your secret.

## Usage

#### Getting the token

Tokens are generated from the model ID.

```ruby
SomeModel.find(1000).token # => o9WM01OR1jgD
```

#### Generating a secret

Secrets are randomly generated by `Model.generate_secret` or `#generate_secret`.
Store the secret using `#password=` or similar encrypted functionality.

```ruby
client = ApiClient.find_by_token('afuoisjdjl') # or  ApiClient.new
client.password = client.generate_secret
client.save # bcrypt/has_secure_password will handle encryption
```

On Rails you may want to use callbacks to generate the password automatically:

```ruby
  before_validation :generate_secret, on: [ :new, :create ]
```

> Calling `generate_secret` on an instance will automatically set password to the new secret.


#### Passing token+secret to client

If your API allows a client to login and then receive a new API token+secret the responding controller method may look something like this.

```ruby
 def try_login
    @email = login_params[:email]
    @pass  = login_params[:password]
    @user = User.find_by(email: @email).try(:authenticate, @pass)
    if @user
      api_client = @user.api_clients.create
      # IMPORTANT - this is the only time you can see the secret decrypted
      render json: { token: api_client.token, secret: api_client.secret }
    else
      render json: {password: ["Invalid account or password"]}, status: :unauthorized
    end
  end
```

To perform authentication with the token + secret, for example as a `before_action` in an `ApplicationController`:

```ruby
def current_user
  if params[:credentials]
    token = credentials_params[:token]
    secret = credentials_params[:secret]
  begin
    api_client = ApiClient.authenticate_by_credentials(token, secret)
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  # if someone sends a decodable token but the record doesn't exist
  end
end

  if api_client
    @current_user = api_client.user
  else
    render json: {errors: ['Unauthorized token or secret']}, status: :unauthorized }
  end
end
```
<!--
Headers are an even better way to pass authentication tokens.  **TODO:**

```ruby

```
-->

#### salt

If you'd like to change the salt used for hashing **IDs** to generate `token`s you can add an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/token_secret_auth.rb

TokenSecretAuth.configure do |config|
    config.id_salt = 'some appropriately salty bytes'
end
```

> Note: the salt used for hashing the secret (password) is controlled by your BCrypt config.

## FAQ

### Why not devise?

Devise is a great solution and I often recommend it.  However, it is sometimes more complexity than needed for something this simple.  TokenSecretAuth does not require devise.

### Why do I need to encrypt my API token?

If your token or token+secret grants a user similar power as a login+password then it should be encrypted with one-way encryption **just like a password**.

### How do I get the secret?

The secret is the password field on the model.  It's only available when the instance is first created after that you can't retrieve it - - that's the whole point of one-way encryption.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
